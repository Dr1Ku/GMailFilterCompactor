Purpose: Compacts many filters which apply a given label into
         multi-part (if there are 100+ filters to compact, for instance)
         filters or a single, consolidated/compacted filter. Prompts
         input for the label's name, works as a bookmarklet as well.

         See ./purpose.png for a visual representation.
         In my case, I compacted 107 generic 'Newsletter' independent filters to 6 (!) compact filters.

Usage: Open the 'Filters' Settings Tab within GMail and run.
